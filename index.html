        <div class="text"><p>I am a graduate of Alma College with a degree in music education. While at Alma College I proudly performed with the Kiltie Marching Band, the Kiltie Wind Ensemble, the Wind and Percussion Consort, the Alma College Jazz band, the Flute Ensemble and Studio, the Pipe Band, and the string quartet 3:1, as well as taught lessons in flute. 3:1 was a project which gave performances at local elementary schools to inspire young musicians to pursue their music educations. Throughout my college career I have also been involved in our chapter of Active Minds; served on the Student Congress Budget Committee; worked with various schools in Gratiot County, including St. Louis High School, Breckenridge High School, and Mt. Pleasant public schools; taught at band camps over the summers; travelled to Italy to further study music with Central Michigan University faculty; and joined a social sorority, Kappa Iota, where I served the chapter on several executive council positions, most notably as President. I completed my student teaching at Mount Pleasant Middle and High Schools, where I helped the marching band prepare for competition at MCBA State Finals and BOA Grand Nationals. I'm very thankful for all of the opportunities and experiences I've had and I hope I can inspire all of my students to seek out ways to share their skills and passions with their communities, as well.
